# Notes
- The server files DO NOT update automatically! So in case of an update, you won't be notified. Make sure to check!
- The server will automatically start itself on boot. File location: shell:startup > youtube-music-discord-rpc-server.lnk
- You obviously need the desktop app of Discord installed
- `Start.vbs` runs the server in the background. If you want to see the console, you can run `server.bat`
